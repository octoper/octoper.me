My name is Vaggelis and I'm a full-stack web developer, I live in Heraklion, Greece and I'm also a student at [Computer Science Department](https://www.csd.uoc.gr/CSD/index.jsp?lang=en) of [University of Crete](http://en.uoc.gr/).

My speciality on the backend is Laravel, nowdays I use both the TALL Stack (TailwindCSS, AlpineJS, Laravel, Livewire) and VITL Stack (Vue.js, Inertia.js, TailwindCSS, Laravel)

I'm also passionate about PWA's, Web components, Javascript, Rust and Golang!
