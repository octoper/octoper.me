ðŸ‘‹ Hey there, I'm Vaggelis, but you may know me better as [@itsoctoper](https://twitter.com/itsoctoper). I live in Heraklion, Greece.

I'm a full-stack web developer and also a student at [Computer Science Department](https://www.csd.uoc.gr/CSD/index.jsp?lang=en) of [University of Crete](http://en.uoc.gr/).

My speciality on the backend is Laravel, nowdays I use both the TALL Stack (TailwindCSS, AlpineJS, Laravel, Livewire) and VITL Stack (Vue.js, Inertia.js, TailwindCSS, Laravel)
